# DiceRoller

My first ever Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This was part of my Flutter course offered by Academind (Maxmillian Schwarzmuller, Udemy)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
