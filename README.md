# DiceRoller

My first ever Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This was part of my Flutter course offered by Academind (Maxmillian Schwarzmuller, Udemy)

Here's the perview of the app:

This project helped me get a good understanding of gradients, containers and other fundamentals of dart and flutter.
